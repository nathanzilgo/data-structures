# data-structures

Practice repository for **data structures and algorithms** across multiple languages, plus a dedicated **LeetCode** area.

## Modules

- **DSA practice**: `./dsa`
  - Topic-based notes, implementations, and exercises.
- **LeetCode**: `./leetcode`
  - Problem-based solutions, organized per problem with optional multi-language solutions.

## Repository structure

```text
data-structures/
  README.md
  dsa/
    README.md
    topics/
  leetcode/
    README.md
```

## Recommended conventions

- **Language folders**: keep solutions grouped by language (e.g. `python/`, `javascript/`, `java/`, `cpp/`).
- **One idea per file**: a single data structure / algorithm / solution per file when possible.
- **Notes live with code**: add short `README.md` notes in the nearest folder when something needs explanation.

## Quick start (examples)

These are optional and depend on which languages you use:

```bash
# Python
python path/to/file.py

# Rust
rustc path/to/file.rs && ./file

# Go
go run path/to/file.go
```
